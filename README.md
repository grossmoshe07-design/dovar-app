This project is a simple Android WebView wrapper for a single-domain site.

Key details:
- Package name / applicationId: mnhg.dovar
- App label: dovar shalom
- Startup URL: https://emailphone.free.nf/
- Offline behavior: Uses WebView cache and serves assets/offline.html when the device is offline.
- Added splash screen that displays the app logo while the app starts.
- Added pull-to-refresh (SwipeRefreshLayout) to refresh the WebView by swiping down.

How to include your high-quality logo:
- If you want the exact image you uploaded used as the launcher icon or in the offline page, upload the PNG and I will add it to the repository (app/src/main/res/drawable/logo.png and use it in assets/offline.html).
